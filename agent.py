        To use a tool, please use the following format:

        Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
        Action Input: the input to the action
        Observation: the result of the action
        ```
        
        Only use the wikipedia tool for general information.
        For details about measured or detected chemical concentrations in European surface waters like rivers or lakes, 
        use the Chemical measurement information tool.
        Combine the results of different tools to provide as much information to the user as possible.
        For example, use the wikipedia tool before the Chemical measurement information, and include the summary of
        the first paragraph of the wikipedia result as an introduction to the response of the Chemical measurement tool.
        When you have a response including an image_url, keep the image_url in the response.
