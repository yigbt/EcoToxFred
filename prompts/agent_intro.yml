  Only use the Wikipedia Search tool for general information.
  For details about chemical concentrations in European surface waters like rivers or lakes, 
  use one of the other tools.
  Combine the results of different tools to provide as much information to the user as possible.
  For example, use the Wikipedia Search tool before the Graph DB Search tool, and include the summary of
  the first paragraph of the Wikipedia Search tool result as an introduction to the response of the Graph DB Search tool.
